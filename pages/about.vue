                <br>
                Hi there. I am an assemblage of:
                <ul>
                  <li>cooperatives / spaces / technologies</li>
                  <li>learnings / teachings / communities</li>
                  <li>systems / heuristics / practices</li>
                  <li>architecture / pedagogy / software</li>
                  <li>families / friends / societies / cultures</li>
                </ul>

                I am a learner, teacher, spatial designer, technologist, and artist, creating design tools, architectural spaces, and social collectives. 
                
                <br><br>I am interested in how our environments and relations change the way we think, feel, collaborate, and play together. I am especially excited about creating and maintaining inclusive and just spaces, organizations, and learning/working structures that are intentional about power, agency, and care.<br><br>
                
                I teach at <a href="https://www.arch.columbia.edu/">Columbia University GSAPP</a>, am a founding member of <a href="https://www.primeproduce.coop/">Prime Produce</a> (an intentional community for social good), <a href="https://www.instagram.com/softsurplus/">Soft Surplus</a> (a community space for making and learning near each other), and the <a href="http://cybernetics.social/">Cybernetics Library</a>, an artist-run library focused on socio-technological systems.!

        <div class="title">Things I am thinking about lately</div>
        (as of 2019-10)<br><br>

        <a href="https://twitter.com/dantaeyoung/status/1185970849423208449">What is the relationship between racism and aesthetics</a>? Doesn't aesthetics or some sort of visual taste always have a form of exclusion that either aids, or is structured by racism? The gated community, the idea of 'purity', the <i>dangerous, dirty, unkempt</i> 'other' -- the racial other is always <i>unaesthetic, disorganized, distasteful</i>. Is there an aesthetics that is untouched by racism and power? What does just pedagogy around representation and aesethetics look like?<br /><br/>
<!--
	Design is often about planning to arrive at an ideal future scenario -- an ideal aesthetics, an ideal construction, an ideal space, an ideal result. Sometimes, design and planning is the start of broadening possibilities, like designing a raised garden bed for an unknown myriad of future plants. Sometimes, design and planning is the narrowing down to a point, when we would like spaces to be built like our construction documents, paper pages to be printed like our screens, travel itineraries to mesh with a 8:42pm flight time. Is it possible to find an aesthetics that can accept broadening possibilities, without falling into the trap of being "modular", "movable", "open source"?<br/><br/> -->

        Is an aesthetics ever possible without a power that enforces it? Is aesthetics itself ever NOT a manifestation of power in terms of form/vision/taste?<br/><br/>

				Feeling like the Other can be a good sign. It is (at least) a sign that I am being myself, when I am in white spaces. Maybe the problem is not the othering of people; it is the "Us"ing of people, the definition of a boundary in which "we" exist, the declaration of <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/virtual-segregation-narrows-our-real-life-relationships">homophily</a> and sharedness that builds gated communities.<br /><br />

				Physical space is a <a href="https://dynamicland.org/">computational medium</a>. Physical space computes things. The sound that a doorbell makes in the space is a social/spatial computation that balances proximity and attention.<br/><br/>

				We are our environments. Our cognition is distributed in the environment. We are the relationships and spaces that surround us. We think through our friends and collaborators and our spaces. If we drew a closed loop around our thought in space, most of it would be outside of our bodies.<br/><br/> 

				A culture of 'professionalism' is predicated on a denial of gender, race, culture, the body, and a denial of (soft, hard) power structures.
				Let's avoid 'professionalism culture' and find healthier ways of thoughtful, insightful action by being in our bodies and acknowledging them. <br /> <br/>

				(or in other words: 'professionalism culture' comes from a hierarchy of effort, an axis of unvalued labor to valued labor, or a (horrible, flawed) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Human_Condition_(book)">labor/work/action</a> hierarchy.
				A taxonomy of labor/work/action or personal/professional is maintained by power & aesthetics.
				Instead: there is no politics without an acknowledgment of our bodies; the personal is political, even though professionalism culture may not want it to be.
				Our environments should support and acknowledge this. If not; it's not worth it.)<br/>
