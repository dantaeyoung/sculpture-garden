Soft Surplus is a place very dear to my heart. What does it mean to share space with each other, to make work, to support each other in our practice, to try to make decisions collectively, to be in community?

Soft surplus was born several times. Spaces are grown, not erected. The first time it was born with a conversation between Austin and I, looking for warehouses, talking about shared futures. The second time it was born on the dry lakebed of a desert, watching the sun set. Another time it was born when we grasped keys and set foot in the space after a beautiful brunch with friends.

At its core soft surplus, to me, is definitely centered around a life practice. This is a framing I think I’ve learned from Austin, and over the years I have gradually begin to understand the radicality of what it means to alter your whole life as part of some pursuit towards self-being. We’re all doing something together, sharing space, growing connections and bonds with each other.

Many things have happened at Soft Surplus. Some of them I remember: an aerial circus performance that Sandra and Lin put on, an oral history interview project, a phenomenal New Year’s Eve party before COVID happened, a mutual aid mask production process that Callil and Austin spearheaded, Soft Kitchens - community dinner evenings that Angeline, Nahee, and I created, Surplus+, a digital agency designed to support subsidized memberships for Soft Surplus, many different IDM final thesis showcases that Elizabeth brought her students to, a beautiful solar balloon workshop that Austin led, Callil creating fantastic surfboards at midnight, Fei doing one of the first interviews in the space, Shea and Adina DJing events early in their budding DJ practices, a beautiful thanksgiving dinner in 2019, a film screening for Fei and Yee-Kay put on, an experimental computational workshop, a concert Fei hosted of ____, Jooyei and I playing bartender at a Soft Kitchen, a beautiful birthday party with Francis, Fiona, and Melanie, wild times cleaning and painting the space with Taylor and others..

Part of the idea of Soft Surplus to me, I think, is to create a kind of space that is rarefied in the city - a shared infrastructure that can exist because we all pool our funds together to pay for a large space. The space is modified by the people inside of it, and grows and shapes based on what is desired.

\[as an architectural project, soft surplus is part of my inquiry into the idea of considering space as an ecology of systems. to use a technological metaphor, if buildings or architecture is the hardware, then social usage is the software. Or a garden metaphor: if buildings or architecture is the soil, the paving, the irrigation system, then the plans, the labor cycles of maintenance, and the dinners that arise from it is important as well.

what is a farm to table space? a full stack architect, so to speak?

architects fantasize about creating spaces in their capacity to hold and shape human behavior, perception, desire. why not jump in and be part of the ecology as well? what better way than to actually have the biggest part of our selves at stake —- our own lives?\]

What does the future of soft surplus hold? I am interested in creating community infrastructure. My friend Caroline says that everything comes from a reading group. This is true, to my experience; the cybernetics conference came from the cybernetics reading group, initially created by Francis and organized by Francis, Sam, Melanie, David, Sarah, Charles, and myself, hosted at Prime Produce. From that conference, the Cybernetics Library emerged.

Perhaps the future of soft surplus is in supporting spaces for study to emerge in NYC. shared infrastructure. The party of shared infrastructure. practices of shared infrastructure. together we weave networks.

Cooperative non-profit.  
we have a board.  
Our goal is to support cooperatives and communities in formation that want to make shared infrastructure
